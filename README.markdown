#BarFoos#

BarFoos is a Javascript application framework. Features are:

    - ECMAscript edition 5 normalization
    - Loosely coupled objects
    - Lots of neat helper methods

The Core of BarFoos is shipped with an integrated mediator. When used 
correctly, you can simply plug in and out any module on your site 
without affecting other modules. So everything keeps working.

Furthermore, the architecture of BarFoos is designed to switch any core 
layer aswell very easily. By default, BarFoos uses jQuery as it's "base 
library" to abstract browser differences. If you're writting a module 
you don't care about the base library at all. The special "Sandbox" 
object is everything a module is able to see of the application. So if 
there is a need to switch the base library, you would only need to adapt 
the Core and Sandbox. All of your modules keep calling the same methods.
